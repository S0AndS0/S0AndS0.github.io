Much of what I write is targeted to a technical audience, however, I'm not going to guarantee that posts here will be frequent or on a particular subject. Generally I haunt Question and Answer (Q&A) forums on the World Wide Web, sometimes to find an answer, and other times to submit an answer for public review. Thankfully such actions have lead to interactions with experts far more skilled than I, that have been mostly positive... mostly.


I'm not one to speak much of myself as a person. Sure I've known adversity, but writing of how dyslexia constantly befuddles spell checkers or other hardships without prompting feels... unwarranted and more than a _bit_ vain. And while I've shared in more than a few triumphs, I much prefer to let the code and content that I publish speak on this subject.


Reach out on Twitter (`@S0_And_S0`) if you wish to say _"Howdy"_, because I'm going to get back to disseminating knowledge into action.
