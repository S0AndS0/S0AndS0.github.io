## Notes and additional tips


Water may be replaced with broth or other liquid of choice, however, beware to
not use too much as there'll be much water that seeps out of ingredients.

Foaming is expected after first few hours of cooking, and usually subsides.
But, for first timers, it may be wise to put slow-cooker in cooking sheet/tray
to help catch seeping caused by adding too much water.
