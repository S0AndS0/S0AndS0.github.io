I recently got yet another message from a scammer that wants to use my
reputation, and local ISP, to commit fraud and likely other crimes.  So thought
I's start sharing these sorts of shenanigans with y'all.

As usual I welcome feed-back from readers via the usual social-media avenues,
and for this category in particular would much appreciate suggestions on how to
better bait these people into time-wasting activities ;-)

If sufficient interest is shown in this sort of content, then I'll be sure to
publish updates and maybe stuff from the considerable backlog of past attempts
from other scammers too.

```yaml
subject: Hello
from: JS Expert <tekken.jin0714@gmail.com>
```

> My name is Cui from China and I'm a full stack developer. I have seen your GitHub profile and it really stuck out to me. I would love to collaborate with you on Upwork.
>
> I have been working with various local clients, but now that my contract has ended, I am considering freelancing on Upwork using a European account.
> Also, If you have some projects, and don't have enough time to handle it, you can choose me and I really hope to work on it.
>
> - Why do I need to use the European Upwork account?
> As you may know, it can be hard for Asian freelancers to get good projects on Upwork compared to European freelancers.
> I think upwork depends on where I live.
> Really it is so difficult to get good jobs using the Asian Upwork account on Upwork.
> So I don't use a China(Asian) account and want to only use the European Upwork account.
>
> - How can I use your Upwork account?
> If you have an Upwork account and don't use it, I wanna use it on your local computer via Teamviewer or Anydesk.
> If not, you can create a new account for me.
> Also, I think if you use your Upwork account part-time, you can use it with me.
> Only I will use your account while you don't use your account.
>
> - How can we transfer money with each other?
> You can add Payoneer or Paypal to your Upwork account and If I earn some money using your Upwork account, we can withdraw it via your Payoneer or Paypal.
> And then you can get 10 % of the money from there and you can send the rest of the money to my Paypal or Payoneer.
>
> - Why do I need access to your locale via Teamviewer or Anydesk?
> If I use your Upwork account using a virtual server such as VPN, VPS, AWS, Upwork detects the proxy server IP and blocks your account.
> So If I can use your account, I must absolutely use it on your local computer via Teamviewer or Anydesk.
> If you worry about your personal secret data on your computer, you can set a VM on your computer and I can use your account on the VM of your computer.
>
> - You don't have to worry about me stealing and have your Upwork account. Why?
> Really there isn't a need to steal and have your Upwork account without you.
> If I use your account on another location using VPN, VPS, your account will be blocked because of an IP location change.
> Also, Upwork requires video chat sometimes, I can't do it without your help.
>
> Please let me know your thoughts on this.
> I look forward to your response.
>
> Thank you for your time and attention.
> Best wishes,
> Cui
